Climate Data Analysis (1963–2030) using Machine Learning
📘 Overview

This project explores global climate change indicators from 1963 to 2030 using data science and machine learning techniques.
It focuses on analyzing how temperature, CO₂ emissions, and precipitation patterns have evolved over time — and predicting future climate trends up to 2030.

By combining data visualization and predictive modeling, this project aims to provide actionable insights about the ongoing impact of climate change.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze historical climate data (2000–2024) to detect long-term patterns.

Forecast future climate indicators (2025–2030) using machine learning.

Study correlations between temperature, CO₂ emissions, and rainfall.

Visualize trends and predictions for global and regional insights.

Support awareness and sustainability through data-driven evidence.
